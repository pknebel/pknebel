# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Pedro Henrique Knebel

I'm a 21 year old from Santa Catarina, Brazil, who is passionate about turning ideas into code and building impactful tech solutions. My journey in technology is driven by curiosity and the challenge of creating end-to-end applicationsâ€”from a robust back-end to an intuitive, modern user interface.

Currently, I'm focused on diving deeper into the Java ecosystem, exploring the power of **Spring Framework** and the speed of **Quarkus** for cloud-native applications. I'm also strengthening my skills in the **Linux** environment, which I see as the foundation for any solid development setup.

### ðŸš€ My Current Focus

* **Back-end with Java:** Diving deeper into `Spring Framework` to build robust APIs and microservices, and exploring `Quarkus` for high performance in containers.
* **Front-end with React:** Building dynamic and reactive user interfaces for the best user experience.
* **Reporting with Jasper Reports:** Learning to transform raw data into complex and visually organized reports.
* **Linux Environment:** Optimizing my development environment and preparing for production-level infrastructures.
